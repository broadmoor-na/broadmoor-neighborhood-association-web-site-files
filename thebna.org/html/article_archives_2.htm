                          <p align="justify">Last Monday Mia Ousley noticed the Alameda 
                            County Industries (ACI) garbage trucks picking up both the trash 
                            and recycling canisters on my block (700 block of Victoria) 
                            and dumping it all into the same trash smasher. Mia contacted 
                            the City's Environmental Services about this, asking them to 
                            find out why the recycling was not being recycled.<br />
                            <br />
                            Jennifer Auletta, the city's Recycling Specialist, said her 
                            office immediately went out to check on the trash trucks themselves. 
                            While the City did not witness this improper behavior, Ms. Auletta 
                            did report the incident to ACI and spoke with ACI and the driver 
                            of our street.<br />
                            <br />
                            Ms. Auletta said the driver had some excuse for picking up the 
                            recycling in front of &quot;Mia's&quot; house only, which the 
                            city apparently does not believe. <br />
                            Therefore, Mia and <em><strong>The BNA</strong></em> is asking 
                            all of us to pay attention to the trash companies activities 
                            in the area, to notice if any further incidents of non-recycling 
                            occurs. <br />
                            <br />
                            If you spot this type of non-recycling activity by ACI, please 
                            call or write</p>

            <strong>Planning Commission Recommends City Council Adopt Its 
              plan<br />
              by Leah Hall, Member of The BNA</strong> </p>
                        <p align="justify">San Leandro&#8217;s Planning Commission recommended 
                          that the City Council adopt the Neighborhood Traffic Calming 
                          Program (NTCP) discussed at last month&#8217;s public hearing. 
                          The NTCP is expected to address excessive speeds and volumes 
                          of traffic, and enhance bicycle and pedestrian safety in residential 
                          neighborhoods.<br />
                          Although only about 20 community members were in attendance, 
                          BNA member Leah Hall was one of them, and she provided the information 
                          for this article.<br />
                          The primary speaker for the meeting was Anna Vickroy, who teaches 
                          classes on traffic calming at San Jose State University and 
                          prepared a similar program for the City of Livermore in 2002. 
                          According to Ms. Vickroy, the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program 
                          is designed to obtain the following objectives, ultimately to 
                          improve the quality of life for neighborhood residents.</p>

                      </blockquote>
                      <div align="center">
                          <p align="justify">To put the program in context, here&#8217;s 
                            a brief account of the city&#8217;s recent traffic calming history. 
                            The Speed Hump Program was adopted in 1997 by the City of San 
                            Leandro. Since that time, about 10 speed bumps a year have been 
                            installed throughout the city with an annual budget of $30,000 
                            per year. To date, the city has spent $90,000- $100,000 on this 
                            program. But the use of speed humps are limited in application 
                            due to physical constraints &#8211; they can&#8217;t be placed 
                            on short blocks or roadway curves due to sight distance constraints. 
                            Additionally, they may contribute to cut-through traffic onto 
                            other parallel residential routes. <br />
                            <br />
                            The NTCP would replace or absorb this program. Its proposed 
                            budget is $100,000 per year. According to Ms. Vickroy, one neighborhood 
                            per year will be selected for traffic calming interventions, 
                            through a competitive process based on the severity of a neighborhood&#8217;s 
                            traffic issues. Neighborhoods with less-severe problems will 
                            move higher on the list over time as projects are completed 
                            through the program. The program recognizes that traffic problems 
                            do not go away over time, so eventually all neighborhoods that 
                            qualify will get their turn.<br />
                            <br />
                            The way the NTCP evaluates and pmyStyleritizes neighborhood complaints 
                            is described in a handbook entitled Handbook of the Neighborhood 
                            Traffic Calming Program, City of San Leandro Engineering and 
                            Transportation Department. It involves a resident calling to 
                            make a complaint and the Traffic &amp; Engineering Department 
                            gathering street data through speed trailers to determine the 
                            street meets at least one of the following minimum criteria:<br />
                            <br />
                            (1) 85th Percentile Speed &#8211; Critical speed is at least 
                            32 mph for residential local roadways and 34 mph for residential 
                            collectors; or<br />
                            (2) Average Daily Traffic &#8211; The average daily volume is 
                            at least 1,000 vehicles for local roadways and 2,000 vehicles 
                            for residential collectors.<br />
                            <br />
                            If one of the minimum criteria is met, the neighborhood will 
                            be placed on the list and pmyStyleritized. The city ranks severity 
                            established through a point system: more points for higher recorded 
                            speeds and higher recorded volume. Points are also accumulated 
                            for collisions over the past three years that may have been 
                            avoided with traffic calming, and also for &#8220;pedestrian 
                            generators&#8221; &#8211; each park, recreation facility, or 
                            other public facility that draws significant pedestrian traffic.<br />
                            <br />
                            Once neighborhoods are pmyStyleritized, the top will be selected. 
                            The city estimates one neighborhood plan can be achieved each 
                            year. The following are considered acceptable traffic calming 
                            measures: speed humps, traffic circles, chicanes, raised crosswalks 
                            and speed tables, raised intersections, medians and gateways, 
                            bulb-outs and chokers and curb extensions, re-striping, and 
                            in-pavement lighted crosswalks. Definitions &#8211; along with 
                            pictures and details &#8211; of each of these measures is available 
                            in the Handbook.<br />
                            Notably, city staff does not consider stop signs appropriate 
                            as speed calming devices. City staff say stop signs are traffic 
                            controls and not traffic calming devices. As such, their use 
                            is governed by state law requiring certain criteria. <br />
                            <br />
                            The city will then hold informational neighborhood meetings, 
                            presenting design concept proposals. Neighborhood balloting 
                            will then occur. A minimum of 50% of ballots must be returned, 
                            and approval must be by at least 67% of the ballots returned. 
                            If the approval rate isn&#8217;t high enough, or not enough 
                            ballots are returned, the neighborhood will have to go back 
                            to the waiting list for next year.<br />
                            <br />
                            Only 8 individuals spoke with complaints about speeding on their 
                            street, and they all lived on Begier.</p>
